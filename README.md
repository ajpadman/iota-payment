# iota payment module
The module brings an IOTA Wallet and handles everything to send or receive IOTA Payments in Javascripts apps.

The IOTA payment module can be run as a server in the standalone mode or included in any js code as a library.

This module also brings an admin dashboard, to managa all payments and payouts and see the status off the wallet.

## How to Use

**Still in development and testing. Unexpected errors and loss of funds may occur. So please use the IOTA Devnet for testing. Feedback is welcome!**

This module can easily extend your nodejs or express app.

[Docs](./docs)

### Install

```bash
$ npm install iota-payment
```

### Usage

Create a .env file with your settings

MAX_PAYMENT_TIME is the time until created paymentes aren't checked anymore in minutes

If you want to send payouts, without receiving iotas via payments first, send the iotas to the first address of the seed (index 0)

```bash
SEED='REPLACEWITHEIGHTYONETRYTESEED'
IOTANODE='https://nodes.thetangle.org:443'
MAX_PAYMENT_TIME=1440
```

Optional add the following to have a payment success in seconds, don't use it with large amounts because a payment will be accepted before confirmation and an attacker could send the iotas to another address

```bash
fast_but_risky=true
zmq_node='tcp://tanglebeat.com:5556'
```

You can add `debug=true` to get more logs for debugging

```bash
var paymentModule = require('iota-payment')
var app = require('express')()

let server = paymentModule.createServer(app)

// Start server with iota-payment module on '/payments'
server.listen(3000, function () {
    console.log(`Server started on http://localhost:3000 `)
})
```
